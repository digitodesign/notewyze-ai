# NoteWyze AI Development Progress

## Project Overview
NoteWyze AI is a lecture companion app that records lectures, transcribes them, generates quizzes, and provides research recommendations using AI.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React Native (Expo) with TypeScript
- Backend: FastAPI (Python)
- Database: Neon DB (Postgres)
- AI: Google Gemini API
- Audio Processing: librosa, soundfile, pydub
