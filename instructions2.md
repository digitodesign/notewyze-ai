2.0 Flash Experimental. Might not work as expected.
Let's detail how the research functionality in NoteWise will work, focusing on leveraging the Gemini API effectively.

Core Idea: After a lecture is transcribed and optionally summarized, the app will use Gemini to generate relevant search queries or suggest specific resources related to the lecture's content.

Implementation Steps:

Triggering Research: The research functionality can be triggered in a few ways:

Automatic after transcription/summarization: Immediately after a lecture is processed, the app can automatically generate research suggestions.
Manual trigger by the user: A button or menu option on the lecture view screen could allow the user to explicitly request research suggestions.
Preparing the Input for Gemini: The input to the Gemini API for research suggestions should be the transcribed text (or the summarized text if you want more concise suggestions). The more context you provide, the better the results.

Prompt Engineering for Gemini: This is critical for getting relevant and useful research suggestions. Here are some prompt engineering strategies:

Simple Keyword Extraction: A basic approach is to ask Gemini to extract keywords from the text.
Extract the most important keywords and concepts from the following text:

[Transcribed Lecture Text]
Generating Search Queries: A more effective method is to ask Gemini to generate search queries that a student could use to find more information.
Generate 3-5 search queries that a student could use to research the following lecture content:

[Transcribed Lecture Text]
Suggesting Specific Resources: You can ask Gemini to suggest specific types of resources, such as academic articles, websites, or videos.
Based on the following lecture content, suggest 3-5 relevant resources, including at least one academic article and one educational website:

[Transcribed Lecture Text]
Combining Approaches: You can combine keyword extraction with search query generation to provide even better results.
Extract the key concepts from the following text and then generate 3-5 search queries related to those concepts:

[Transcribed Lecture Text]
Calling the Gemini API: Your backend service will send the prepared prompt (from step 3) to the Gemini API. You'll need to use the appropriate Gemini endpoint and parameters for text generation.

Processing the Gemini Response: The Gemini API will return a response containing the generated keywords, search queries, or resource suggestions. Your backend service should parse this response and format it appropriately for the mobile app.

Displaying Research Suggestions in the App: The app should display the research suggestions in a clear and user-friendly way. Here are some options:

List of search queries: Display the generated search queries as clickable links that open in the user's default browser or a web view within the app.
List of resources with descriptions: If Gemini provides resource suggestions with descriptions, display them in a list with titles, brief summaries, and links.
Tags/Keywords: Display the extracted keywords as clickable tags that could be used to filter or search within the app.
Example Implementation (Conceptual Backend Code - Node.js with the Google Cloud client libraries):

JavaScript

const { VertexAI } = require('@google-cloud/vertexai');

async function generateResearchSuggestions(lectureText) {
  const vertexAI = new VertexAI({project: 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID', location: 'us-central1'});
  const model = vertexAI.getGenerativeModel({model: 'gemini-pro'});

  const prompt = `Generate 3-5 search queries that a student could use to research the following lecture content:\n\n${lectureText}`;

  const request = {
    prompt: {
      text: prompt,
    },
  };

  try {
    const response = await model.generateText(request);
    const suggestions = response.responses[0].text.split('\n').filter(s => s.trim() !== ''); // Basic splitting
    return suggestions;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error generating research suggestions:', error);
    return [];
  }
}
Key Considerations:

Prompt Engineering: Experiment with different prompts to find what works best for your specific use case.
Error Handling: Implement proper error handling in your backend service and in the app to handle API errors and unexpected responses.
Rate Limiting: Be aware of the Gemini API's rate limits and implement appropriate handling to avoid exceeding them.
User Experience: Design the research suggestion display to be clear, concise, and easy to use.
By following these steps, you can create a powerful research functionality that helps students quickly find relevant information related to their lectures. Remember that iterative testing and refinement are key to achieving the best results with AI-powered features.   






will the voice be clean, how do we clean that audio to remove noise and make it ready for tts?



2.0 Flash Experimental. Might not work as expected.
The quality of the transcription from speech-to-text (STT) depends heavily on the audio quality. Background noise, low recording volume, and other audio artifacts can significantly impact the accuracy of the transcription. While Gemini's STT is robust, pre-processing the audio is essential for optimal results.   

Here's a breakdown of how to improve audio quality for STT:

1. Recording Best Practices:

Use a good quality microphone: External microphones or headsets generally produce better results than built-in phone microphones.   
Minimize background noise: Record in a quiet environment.   
Consistent recording volume: Maintain a consistent distance between the speaker and the microphone.   
Appropriate recording format: Use a common audio format like WAV or MP3.   
2. Audio Pre-processing Techniques (Backend):

These techniques are best implemented on your backend service before sending the audio to the Gemini API.

Noise Reduction:

Noise suppression algorithms: Libraries like libsndfile (C/C++) or Python libraries like librosa and noisereduce offer noise reduction algorithms (e.g., spectral subtraction, Wiener filtering). These algorithms estimate the noise profile in the audio and subtract it.   
Example (Python with noisereduce):
Python

import soundfile as sf
import noisereduce as nr

def reduce_noise(audio_path, output_path):
    data, rate = sf.read(audio_path)
    reduced_noise = nr.reduce_noise(y=data, sr=rate)
    sf.write(output_path, reduced_noise, rate)

# Example usage
reduce_noise("input.wav", "output_cleaned.wav")
  Gain Normalization/Automatic Gain Control (AGC): This adjusts the audio volume to a consistent level. It can help with recordings where the speaker's volume varies. Libraries like pydub (Python) can be used for this.   

Python

from pydub import AudioSegment

def normalize_audio(input_path, output_path, target_dbfs=-20.0):
    audio = AudioSegment.from_wav(input_path)
    normalized_audio = audio.normalize(target_dbfs=target_dbfs) # target_dbfs is the desired loudness in dBFS
    normalized_audio.export(output_path, format="wav")

normalize_audio("input.wav", "output_normalized.wav")

  Voice Activity Detection (VAD): This detects segments of audio that contain speech and removes silence or non-speech segments. This can improve transcription accuracy and reduce processing time. Libraries like webrtcvad (C/C++ wrapper for WebRTC's VAD) or Python libraries like silence-remove are available.   

Filtering: High-pass or band-pass filters can be used to remove specific frequency ranges that contain noise (e.g., low-frequency rumble or high-frequency hiss). Libraries like scipy.signal (Python) can be used for filtering.   

Audio Format Conversion: Ensure the audio is in a format supported by the Gemini API (e.g., linear PCM WAV or FLAC). You might need to convert the audio format using libraries like ffmpeg.

3. Implementation in Your Project:

Backend Service: Implement the chosen audio pre-processing techniques in your backend service (e.g., using a Cloud Function or a dedicated server).
Audio Upload: The mobile app will upload the recorded audio to your backend service.
Processing and Transcription: The backend service will pre-process the audio and then send it to the Gemini API for transcription.
Return Transcription: The backend service will return the transcription to the mobile app.
Example Flow:

User records a lecture in the app.
The app uploads the audio file (e.g., as a multipart form data) to your backend service.
The backend service:
Receives the audio file.
Performs noise reduction, gain normalization, and optionally VAD and filtering.
Sends the pre-processed audio to the Gemini API for transcription.
Receives the transcription from the Gemini API.
Returns the transcription to the app.
The app displays the transcription to the user.
Which Techniques to Use?

For most cases, noise reduction and gain normalization will provide the most significant improvement in transcription accuracy.
VAD is useful for recordings with long periods of silence.
Filtering can be helpful if you know the specific frequency ranges of the noise in your recordings.
Important Considerations:

Computational Cost: Audio processing can be computationally intensive. Optimize your code and consider using asynchronous processing or background tasks to avoid blocking the user interface.   
Testing and Tuning: Test different pre-processing techniques and parameters to find what works best for your specific recording conditions and audio characteristics.
By implementing these audio pre-processing techniques, you can significantly improve the quality of your transcriptions and provide a much better user experience. Remember that a combination of good recording practices and backend pre-processing is the most effective approach.
